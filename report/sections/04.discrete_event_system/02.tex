\section{Question 2}

The set of states of the discrete event system that models the complete
manufacturing process $Q$ will be a subset of the set of states comprised by
the combination of all states of the DES of machines $M_1$, $M_2$ and buffer $M$:

$$Q \subseteq Q_{M_1} \times Q_{M_2} \times Q_{B}$$

Table \ref{tbl:04.02_all_states} features the complete set of states that result
from the combination of states of $M_1$, $M_2$ and $B$. Here we can see that
some states do not have a meaning in the process, for example state $(I,I,F)$,
where both machines are idle but the buffer is full does not correspond to
real-life conditions.
