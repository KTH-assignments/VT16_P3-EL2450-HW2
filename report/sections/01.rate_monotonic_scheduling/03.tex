\subsubsection{Question 3}

All pendula are stable. We observe that the higher the natural frequency of a
pentulum, the quicker the response is in its rise time, although with magnified
overshoot. This makes sense since the higher the natural frequency of a
pendulum, the lower its length and the more difficult it is to stabilize, hence
the control must be swift. Figure \ref{fig:01.3} shows the angular displacement
of each pendulum.
