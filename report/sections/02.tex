\section{Question 2}

A set of periodic tasks $\{J_i\}$ is schedulable with Rate Monotonic scheduling
if $$U = \sum_{i} \dfrac{C_i}{T_i} \leq n(2^{1/n} - 1)$$

In the case where $T_1 = 20, T_2 = 29, T_3 = 35$ ms and $C_i = 6$ ms,
$i=\{1,2,3\}$, $U=0.678$ and $n(2^{1/n} - 1) = 0.78$. Hence tasks $J_1, J_2, J_3$
are schedulable with RM.
