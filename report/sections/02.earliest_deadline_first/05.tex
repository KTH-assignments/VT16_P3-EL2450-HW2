\subsubsection{Question 5}
In the case where $T_1 = 20, T_2 = 29, T_3 = 35$ ms and $C_i = 10$ ms,
$i=\{1,2,3\}$, $U=1.131 > 1$. Hence tasks $J_1, J_2, J_3$ are not schedulable
under any scheduling scheme.

    %schedulability.}

Here we note that the lack of feasibility of a schedule is connected to the
notion and fact of deadlines not being met. This, however, does not mean that
there can be no control over a system. All penduli are stable as opposed to the
case of RM scheduling with the same execution time. This is because all control
tasks can be preemped, hence every one of them is allowed execution in the
processor, which results to all of them being executed. Hence, despite the fact
that deadlines are missed, it is possible to control all three penduli, although
it may be with worse control performance than in the case where $C_i = 6$ ms.

Due to the missing of deadlines, and, ultimately, due to the increased execution
time, the control input is not as swift as before, hence the increased magnitude
of the overshoot and the larger rise and settling times. Figure \ref{fig:02.5.2}
shows the angular displacement of each pendulum as a function of time.
Figures \ref{fig:02.5.6_10.1}, \ref{fig:02.5.6_10.2} and \ref{fig:02.5.6_10.3}
show the angular displacement of penduli $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ respectively, as
a function of time, for the two different cases of execution time.

Figure \ref{fig:02.5.3} shows the schedule calculated for each pendulum with all
tasks having execution time $C_i = 10$ ms. Figure \ref{fig:02.5.4} illustrates
that the schedule is not feasible by ploting the overall usage of the CPU over
the length of a schedule period, which is at all times $100\%$, indicative of
the excessive processing load demanded.
