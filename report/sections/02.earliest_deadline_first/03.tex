\subsubsection{Question 3}

All pendula are stable for execution time $C_i = 6$ ms. We observe that the
higher the natural frequency of a pentulum, the quicker the response is in its
rise time, although with magnified overshoot. This makes sense since the higher
the natural frequency of a pendulum, the lower its length and the more difficult
it is to stabilize, hence the control must be swift. Figure \ref{fig:02.3} shows
the angular displacement of each pendulum.
