\subsubsection{Question 2}

As stated above, a set of periodic tasks $\{J_i\}$ is schedulable under Earliest
Deadline First scheduling if and only if
$$U = \sum_{i} \dfrac{C_i}{T_i} \leq 1$$
In the case where $T_1 = 20, T_2 = 29, T_3 = 35$ ms and $C_i = 6$ ms,
$i=\{1,2,3\}$, $U=0.678 \leq 1$. Hence tasks $J_1, J_2, J_3$ are schedulable
with EDF. A portion of the calculated schedule can be found in
the appendix in figure \ref{fig:edf_6}.
