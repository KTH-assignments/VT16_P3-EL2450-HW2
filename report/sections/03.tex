\section{Question 3}

All penduli are stable. We observe that the higher the natural frequency of a
pentulum, the quicker is the response both in rise and settling time, although
with magnified overshoot. This makes sense since the higher natural frequency,
the lower the length of the pendulum, hence the control must be swift.
